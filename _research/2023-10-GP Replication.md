## Abstract

Gagliarducci and Paserman study gender differences in cooperation among politicians using data from the U.S. House of Representatives in 1988–2010. The evidence is consistent with commonality of interest driving cooperation, rather than gender per se. We show that GP's results are robust to the correction of some errors in the control variables and to clustering standard errors at the individual level, instead of individual‐term. Additional data from 2011 to 2020 confirms the relevance of the ideological distance between male and female representatives, but also indicates that in recent years female politicians tend to recruit more co‐sponsors for the bills that they sponsor.
