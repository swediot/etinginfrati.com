I'm an early career researcher in labour econonics with a focus on non-wage amenities and compensation inequality. My interest also include trade, and gender economics. I aim to shed light on these interconnected fields, providing valuable insights into their real-world impact. Feel free to contact me at [giulian@etinginfrati.com](mailto:giulian@etinginfrati.com).
